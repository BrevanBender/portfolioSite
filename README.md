[carousel on about me, email modal on main page, modal on projects] Three pieces of interaction
[x] pages: home, bio, resume, projects, links
[x] responsive design 

Each page rundown :

    Home/Greeting: basic page with header that links to everything using anchor tags. A button at the button sets modal display to flex instead of none to show pop up. Modal conatains simply form courtesy of form submit (yes it does work) I need to work on boxshadow animations behind picture as of 11:57

    About Me: ugly page stil need to style that 11:57. A couple simple text elements and a carousel identical to the one I had used at earlier commits except is shows pictures of mine that I like. This is done using the nth of type css selector and event listeners on buttons to change order.

    projects: I started with an object containing data on projects. I then used jqeury to render them onto a container and looped through giving them each a modal function similar to the email on main page. this is all placeholders I want to style this page more. I added a parallax effect using data-speed to assign numbers to html elements than translate the elements at there respective speed giving the page depth

    resume: I pretty much treated this as a flexbox lab with tons of placeholders. I feel bad doing this but I need some serious help with my resume

    11: 57 ==>  ***I haven't tested my responsive design for 4k monitors
                   
                   Holistically I would like to add some fonts and styling to make this feel more professional. I intend on adding more animation as well.
