        <p>
        After my college career was derailed by the pandemic, I decided to give coding a try. The more I learned, the more I loved it. After countless hours of online tutorials and passion projects, I decided it was in my best interest to seek more structure in my learning. Enter General Assembly. I started my GA experience February 2022 and, despite us and downs, haven't regretted it a single day. Beyond the digital world, I love the outdoors. I'm an avid hiker and mediocre skiier. While outside I also like to fly my drone and record from the sky's perspective.
